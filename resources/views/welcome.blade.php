          Assets: houses and listings
          <br>
          Participants: buyers and homeowners
          <br>
          Transactions: buying or selling houses, and creating and closing listings
          <br>
          Participants can have their access to transactions restricted based on their role as either a buyer, seller, or realtor. The realtor can then create an application to present buyers and sellers with a simple user interface for viewing open listings and making offers. This business network could also be integrated with existing inventory system, adding new houses as assets and removing sold properties. Relevant other parties can be registered as participants, for example a land registry might interact with a buyer to transfer ownership of the land.
